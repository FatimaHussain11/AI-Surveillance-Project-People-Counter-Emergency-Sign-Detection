## **Features** :sparkles:
- **People Counting:** Detects and counts individuals in frames or video streams to monitor crowd density and occupancy.  
- **Emergency Sign Detection:** Recognizes critical signs like **"Help," "Danger,"** or **"Peace"**, sending instant alerts.  
- **Surveillance Camera Integration:** Works with both **live cameras** and pre-recorded videos.  
- **AI-Powered Detection:** Utilizes **deep learning models** for fast and accurate performance in various environments.  
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Alerts authorities or personnel immediately upon detecting emergencies or abnormal crowd density.
